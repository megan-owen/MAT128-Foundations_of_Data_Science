Testing Hypotheses](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/Testing_Hypotheses.html) in the [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) textbook. \n",

    "### 14.1 Jury Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on [11.1 Assessing a Model](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/1/Assessing_a_Model.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "In the US, a jury should be selected from a jury panel (the prospective jurors) that is representative of the local population.  This condition helps a jury be impartial, so if a group is systematically underrepresented on the jury panels, it raises questions about the impartiality and fairness of the trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robert Swain was a Black man convicted in Talladega County, Alabama in 1962, who appealed his case all the way to the Supreme Court on the grounds of Black people being systematically excluded from juries in Talladega County.  This lab will focus on the composition of the jury panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of the trial, 26% of the population of Talladega County was Black, but only 8 men out of the 100 men on the jury panel, or 8%, were Black (only men were allowed to serve on juries in Talladega County then).  The Supreme Court concluded this discrepancy (8% on the jury panel vs. 26% in the local population) was small and the result of chance.  While we would not necessary expect 26 Black men on the jury panel, how likely is 8?  Could this be the result of chance?  Or is it more likely due to the pervasive racial biases at the time?\n",
    "\n",
    "See Sections [11.1.1](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/1/Assessing_a_Model.html#jury-selection), [11.1.9](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/1/Assessing_a_Model.html#racial-bias), and [11.1.10](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/1/Assessing_a_Model.html#further-reading) for more details about this case and racial bias in the legal system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our simulations\n",
    "We want to simulate the probability that if 100 prospective jurors are chosen at random from a population that is 26% Black, 8 or fewer of them are Black.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to define the population (Black and Non-Black) and specify the probability for each group, as in Lab 12.  We can also call this population our *model*, because we are assuming it is an explanation for the data."
