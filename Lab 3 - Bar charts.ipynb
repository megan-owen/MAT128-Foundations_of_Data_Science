    "#### Statistical data types\n",
    "The statistical types of our data tells us what kinds of analyses and visualizations we can do.  The two main types of data in this class:\n",
    "- *qualitative*: non-numerical information.  We mainly use *categorical* data, in which the data values are categories (ex. marital status, grade level, zip code)\n",
    "- *quantitative*: numerical information that measures something.  Quantitative data is further divided into:\n",
    "   - *discrete*: finite or countably infinite number of possible values. Ex. number of books, number of people\n",
    "   - *continuous*: possible values contain an interval of the real numbers or are uncountably infinite.  Ex. weight of pigs, height of trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are considered continuous if it is only limitations in the measuring tool that make it look discrete (ex. measuring the height of trees to the nearest inch).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The *distribution* of the data in the column refers to which data values are more common and less common.  We visualize the distribution of categorial data using a *bar chart*.\n",
